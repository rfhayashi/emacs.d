# Emacs Config

This is my emacs configuration.

This configuration is meant to be used with [chemacs2](https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2).
Since it is also based on [Straight](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el),
chemacs profile should activate it.

This is an example of a `~/.emacs-profiles.el`:

```elisp
(("default" . ((user-emacs-directory . "<this repo dir>")
               (straight-p . t))))
```

This is constantly evolving and there are no guarantees that it will work everywhere,
but feel free to use it entirely or copy parts of it.
